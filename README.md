# sim-homodyne
Python code to simulate optical homodyne detection of a quantum state

## NOTE: Under Heavy Development
As of May/June 2022, this code is under heavy development and is really just getting peiced together. 

More documentation to follow. 

For now testsim.py runs a sample generation of **N** homoodyne traces
